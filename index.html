        <h2>BIOGRAPHY</h2>
        <p>My name is Kamisi Temiloluwa,student Id number is ALT/SOE/023/3053,Female,Nigerian,28years of age.I attended Obafemi Awolowo University,Ile-Ife Osun State,Nigeria.Where i studied law and proceeded to the Nigerian Law school,Enugu Campus,there i got my professional degree to practice law after passing the Bar exam and was called to the Nigerian Bar.</p>
        <p>I am a newbie on this journey into software engineering,having no experience in IT in any high level.My reason for joining AlT school Africa is to learn new skills in software engineering and be able to use these skills.My track choice in the School of engineering is Cloud engineering,which is learning something new that is out of my area of expertise and makes me to step out of my confort zone.Another reason is that technology has evolved a whole lot and is needed in almost all areas of expertise in the world,which makes the skills very sought after on a global scale and improving my chances in the labour force.</p>
        <h2> My Goals Are:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>To be a world class software engineer</li>
            <li>To learn new software skills</li>
            <li>To be able to use the skills learnt to become a cloud engineer</li>
            <li>To broaden my chances of getting the jobs i want</li>
        </ol>
